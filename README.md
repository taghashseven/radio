## about the project 
- Our application server simulates an online radio station with the primary goal of enabling synchronized music playback across connected devices. By preloading the audio file and issuing synchronous commands to clients, we ensure that each device plays the same music at the exact same instance in time. This seamless synchronization enhances the user experience, allowing listeners to enjoy the music in perfect harmony, regardless of their location or device.
